## About

![Participants in Dagstuhl Seminar 24161](/assets/images/24161.02.s.jpg){: .align-right}

We assume communities just happen, but it's hard work!

### About the title

The title of the site, "(R)SE(R)", is (nearly) a regular expression for various abbreviations we used a lot in our discussions:
software engineering (SE); 
software engineering research (SER);
research software (RS);
research software engineering (RSE); and
research software engingineering research (RSER), aka research on RSE.
The proper regular expression would be "(R)?SE(R)?".
