## About

Research software is crucial to all computational research across many academic disciplines. Multiple communities are invested in research software, including computer scientists, and first and foremost among them, software engineering researchers, who investigate and develop methods to improve the quality of software and its lifecycle processes. The software engineering for science community does this specifically for research software. Research software engineers (RSEs) in turn select, customize, and apply software engineering methods from computer science within the domain of academic research to create research software.

There is currently an insufficient transfer of state-of-the-art research knowledge from computer science to research software engineering, and vice versa, in part, leading to an incomplete understanding in computer science of the domain-specific and general challenges in research software engineering.

This interactive seminar therefore brings the computer science and software engineering research community and the research software engineering community together to define a common language, and apply it to improve reciprocal knowledge transfer.

### About the title

The title of the site, "(R)SE(R)", is (nearly) a regular expression for various abbreviations we used a lot in our discussions:
software engineering (SE); 
software engineering research (SER);
research software (RS);
research software engineering (RSE); and
research software engineering research (RSER), aka research on RSE.
The proper regular expression would be "(R)?SE(R)?".
